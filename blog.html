    <h4> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? </h4>
    <p> I had a lot of problems with this assignment, such as setting js code, how to set the search, create the new twit including text and author, and how to sync with html. </p>
    <p> Although this assignment is similar to the previous C code, the structure is not difficult to understand, but some parameters are still very complex to pass. </p>
    <p> By asking students and Google search, I learned that when searching, I needed to compare the input string to the existing string and then display the search results in a white box.</p>
    <p> And by watching Hess videos, there are some code that I can use in my homework and can run. It is very helpful to me. </p>

    <h4> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew? </h4>
    <p> I also learned how to search within a web page and how to search. I also learned how to create a new text box and can add content and authors, and can be in the same format as an existing text box. </p>
    <p> format as an existing text box. </p>

    <h4> What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h4>
    <p> I think the classroom notes are the most helpful, the teacher has made most of the code templates that need to be used clearly in class, the problem we encounter in </p>
    <p> the process of writing homework is that we may not be familiar with the use of a certain piece of code, need to ask TA to get help. TA these questions are basically </p>
    <p> answered, we also learn more about the relevant code application. </p>

    <h4> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment? </h4>
    <p> I used google to check some font settings, and some code templates in approximate format, through which I refined my code. </p>
